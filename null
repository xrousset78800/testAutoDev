I see you're expecting a file, but it's not specified which one!

If I had to guess, based on the previous tasks, I'd say you might be looking for `index.html`, right? If that's correct, here is the updated version:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello World</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="hello">Hello World!</h1>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Let me know if I'm correct or not!
