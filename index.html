Here is the `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello World</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="hello">Hello World!</h1>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

This HTML file includes the newly created `style.css` and `script.js` files, as well as a basic "hello world" heading that will be affected by the animation.
