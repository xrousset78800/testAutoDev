Based on your project, I assume you have a basic HTML file with some JavaScript code. Here are the files that need to be modified or created:

file: {
action: "update",
name: index.html,
actionDescription: "Update the HTML file to include the animation"
},

file: {
action: "update",
name: script.js,
actionDescription: "Update the existing JavaScript file with animation code"
}

These are the only two files that need attention. No new files need to be created or modified for this task.
